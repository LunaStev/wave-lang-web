# Philosophy and Goals of Wave

Wave aims to overcome the limitations of low-level languages and establish an integrated ecosystem where development across various fields can be done using a single language.
This language possesses versatility that spans multiple domains, including web development, operating systems, artificial intelligence, blockchain, hardware, compilers, networking, and cryptography.

Notably, Wave is designed to be accessible even to developers without deep knowledge of hardware.
To achieve this, Wave's standard hardware library allows users to intuitively utilize hardware functionalities without requiring extensive technical expertise. Additionally, it provides direct hardware control capabilities, offering flexibility for deeper control when necessary.

With these features, Wave helps users maximize hardware functionality while minimizing code complexity.
Ultimately, developers can handle various tasks with a single language and experience an integrated development environment that ensures efficient performance.

## Performance and Efficiency
Wave is designed as a high-performance language, supporting optimized code execution and providing features that maximize performance across different platforms.
This ensures stable performance for applications in fields such as web development, operating systems, and artificial intelligence.

## Safety and Error Handling
Wave prioritizes safe programming by thoroughly inspecting potential errors at compile time, thereby minimizing runtime errors.
The language ensures memory safety and type safety while maintaining high performance.

## Enhancing Developer Productivity
Wave offers an intuitive and concise syntax, allowing developers to learn quickly and develop efficiently.
Furthermore, with its rich standard libraries and tools (such as Vex and WSON), developers can handle complex tasks more easily.

## Platform Independence
Wave is designed to allow the same code to run across multiple operating systems.
By providing a platform-independent development environment, developers can write code once and deploy applications across different environments seamlessly.

## Community and Extensibility
Wave will continue to evolve through close collaboration with the open-source community.
It provides an open environment where users and developers can extend and enhance the language's features.
Through customization and extensions, Wave can be adapted for specific domains and requirements.

## Future-Oriented Goals
Wave aims to integrate functionalities suitable for emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and distributed systems.
This vision ensures that Wave is not limited to today's development environment but can also lead the advancements of future technologies.
