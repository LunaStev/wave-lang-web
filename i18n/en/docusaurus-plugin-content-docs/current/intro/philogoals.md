# Philosophy and Goals of Wave

Wave aims to overcome the limitations of low-level languages and build an integrated ecosystem where development can be done in a single language across various fields.
This language has the versatility to cover multiple fields such as web development, operating systems, artificial intelligence, blockchain, hardware, compilers, networking, and encryption.

Especially, Wave is designed to be easily used by developers without deep knowledge of hardware.
To this end, Waveâ€™s standard hardware library helps users utilize it intuitively without needing complex hardware-related knowledge. Additionally, it provides functions for direct hardware control, offering flexibility for deeper levels of control as needed.

These features of Wave help users maximize hardware capabilities while minimizing code complexity.
Ultimately, developers can handle diverse tasks with a single language and experience an integrated development environment that implements efficient performance.

## Performance and Efficiency

Wave is designed as a high-performance language, supporting optimized code execution and offering features to maximize performance across various platforms.
This allows for stable maintenance of necessary performance in various fields like web, operating systems, and artificial intelligence.

## Safety and Error Handling

Wave prioritizes safe programming. It thoroughly checks for compile-time errors to minimize runtime errors.
This language ensures memory safety, type safety, etc., without sacrificing performance.

## Improving Developer Productivity

Wave offers intuitive and concise syntax that helps developers learn quickly and develop efficiently.
Furthermore, with a rich standard library and tools (like Vex, WSON), developers can handle complex tasks more easily.

## Platform Independence

Wave is designed to allow the same code to run across various operating systems.
It provides a development environment independent of platforms, allowing developers to create applications that can run in various environments with a single code write-up.

## Community and Extensibility

Wave will continue to evolve through close cooperation with the open-source community.
It provides a free environment where users and developers can expand and improve the capabilities of the Wave language.
Customization and extension allow Wave to be modified and used according to specific fields or requirements.

## Future-Oriented Goals

Wave will continue to integrate functions suitable for the latest technologies like artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and distributed systems, reflecting ever-evolving tech trends.
This vision allows Wave to establish itself as a language not only limited to today's development environments but also capable of leading future technological advancements.
