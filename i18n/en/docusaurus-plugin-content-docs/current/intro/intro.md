# Introduction
## Wave's philosophy and goals
Wave is designed to simplify and complement low-level programming by providing a versatile, unified language that bridges diverse domains of development. Rather than aiming to replace low-level languages like C and Assembly, Wave focuses on creating a robust and cohesive development ecosystem that spans areas such as web development, operating systems, artificial intelligence, blockchain, hardware, compilers, networking, and cryptography.

Wave’s core philosophy is to offer high-level abstraction through a powerful standard library while preserving the capability for precise low-level control. This allows developers to perform intricate operations when necessary while enjoying the productivity benefits of a streamlined environment.

One of Wave's defining features is its hardware library, which simplifies hardware interaction for developers with limited expertise while retaining the flexibility for direct and detailed hardware manipulation when required. This combination empowers developers to intuitively access hardware capabilities without sacrificing performance.

In essence, Wave seeks to blur the lines between high-level and low-level programming, delivering an integrated language environment for a seamless and intuitive development experience.
