# Introduction

## Philosophy and Goals of Wave

Wave aims to complement and simplify low-level programming languages while providing a versatile and unified language that encompasses various fields of development. Rather than replacing low-level languages, Wave focuses on creating a robust and consistent development ecosystem that spans diverse domains such as web development, operating systems, artificial intelligence, blockchain, hardware, compilers, networking, and cryptography.

The core philosophy of Wave is to provide high-level abstractions through a powerful standard library while maintaining precise low-level control. This enables intuitive handling of complex tasks while still allowing precise and sophisticated operations when needed.

One of Wave’s key features is its hardware library, designed to be easily accessible even to developers with limited expertise in hardware. It also offers the flexibility to directly control hardware when detailed, fine-grained control is required. This combination enables developers to intuitively leverage hardware capabilities without sacrificing performance.

Wave aims to break the boundaries between high-level and low-level programming, offering an intuitive and unified language environment that simplifies the development experience.
