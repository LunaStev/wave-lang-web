# Running Your First Program
If you’ve already installed Wave following the previous installation guide, let’s now run your very first program!

## Creating the `hello.wave` File
First, create a new file named `hello.wave`.

## Writing the Code
Write the following code inside the `hello.wave` file:

```wave
fun main() {
    println("Hello Wave");
}
```

Here, `fun main()` represents the entry point of the program, and the `println` function prints text to the screen.

## Running the Program
Now let’s run the Wave program. Open your terminal and enter the following command:

```bash
wavec run hello.wave
```

## Checking the Output
When you run the program, you should see the following output:

```
Hello Wave
```

Now you can confirm that Wave is properly installed and working. Congratulations! You’ve successfully run your first program.
