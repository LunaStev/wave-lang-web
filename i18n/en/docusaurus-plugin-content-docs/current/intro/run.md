# Run the first program

If you've already installed Wave in the previous installation document, let's run the first program now!

## Create `hello.wave` file.

First, create a new file named `hello.wave`.

## Write the code

Write the following code in `hello.wave` file:

```wave
fun main() {
    println("Hello Wave");
}
```

Here, `fun main()` indicates the starting point of the program, and the `println` function outputs the text to the screen.

## Run the program

Now let's run the Wave program. Open the terminal and enter the following command:

```bash
wavec run hello.wave
```

## Check the output

When you run the program, the following output will appear:

```
Hello Wave
```

Now you can check that Wave is installed and working correctly. Congratulations! You have successfully run your first program.
