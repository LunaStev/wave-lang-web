# Running Your First Program

If you have already installed Wave following the previous installation guide, it's time to run your first program!

## Creating the `hello.wave` File

First, create a new file named `hello.wave`.

## Writing the Code

Open the `hello.wave` file and write the following code:

```wave
fun main() {
    println("Hello Wave");
}
```

Here, `fun main()` represents the entry point of the program, and the `println` function prints text to the screen.

## Running the Program

Now, let's run the Wave program. Open your terminal and enter the following command:

```bash
wave run hello.wave
```

## Checking the Output

When you execute the program, you should see the following output:

```
Hello Wave
```

Now you have confirmed that Wave is installed and working correctly. Congratulations! You have successfully run your first program.
