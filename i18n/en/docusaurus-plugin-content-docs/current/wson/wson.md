# Wave Serialization Object Notation

WSON (Wave Serialized Object Notation) is the fundamental data serialization format for the Wave programming language, designed to overcome the limitations of traditional JSON, providing more powerful features and efficiency. WSON maintains a structure that is easy to read and write, while maximizing performance, to ensure safer and faster data exchange across various environments.

## Features

### 1. **Strict Type System**

WSON maintains a precise data type, eliminating the unpredictability caused by JSON's dynamic types. This ensures type stability during serialization and deserialization of data.

### 2. **High Performance**

WSON is designed to have minimal overhead, allowing for fast data processing speeds. This is particularly effective when serializing large volumes of data.

### 3. **Wave-Friendly Design**

It is designed to integrate seamlessly with the Wave programming language and is natively supported by Wave's standard library.

### 4. **Readability and Easy Parsing**

It retains a JSON-like syntax but allows for more concise expressions, making it easier for humans to read and edit directly. Additionally, it is optimized for efficient parsing.

### 5. **Support for Various Data Structures**

WSON supports not only simple key-value pairs but also complex data structures like native arrays, structs, and tuples. This allows for a more flexible data representation.

## Applications

- Data storage and transmission in Wave-based applications

- Network communication and API data format

- File storage and configuration file formats

- Serialization and deserialization of large data sets

## Conclusion

WSON aims for more efficient and powerful data serialization by reflecting the philosophy of the Wave language. It is designed to overcome the drawbacks of traditional JSON while maintaining an intuitive syntax, making it easier for developers to use. In the future, WSON will establish itself as the standard data format in the Wave ecosystem, providing robust performance in various environments.
