# Wave Ecosystem

## Overview

The Wave ecosystem is more than just a programming language.
It is a comprehensive development ecosystem that helps programmers work creatively in any field through a combination of various tools, libraries, and development philosophies.

## Components of the Wave Ecosystem
### Wave
The core of the Wave ecosystem is the Wave programming language.
Based on the philosophies of C and Rust, it is designed to balance low-level control with high productivity.

* **Easy learning curve**: Intermediate difficulty between C and Rust.
* **Powerful features**:  Supports a variety of data types such as pointers, arrays, and serialization.

### Standard Library
Wave provides a rich standard library to prevent programmers from having to rely on external libraries.

* **hardwave**: Hardware control
* **http**: HTTP and WebSocket communication
* **iosys**: File and stream I/O
* **sys**: System control
* **wson**: High-performance data serialization format
* **quantum**: Quantum computing support

### Community and Ecosystem Philosophy
Wave values interaction with developers, not just the language itself.

* **Developer-centered design**: Respects various languages and cultures.
* **Support for minority languages and dialects**: Embraces global language diversity.
* **Future-oriented technology**: Supports quantum computing and next-generation security standards.

### Toolchain
Wave maximizes productivity through a complete set of development tools.

* **Wave Package Manager (Vex)**: Platform-independent builds and deployments.
* **Wave Debugger**: Intuitive debugging.
