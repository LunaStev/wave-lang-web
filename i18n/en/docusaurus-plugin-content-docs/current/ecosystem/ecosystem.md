# Wave Ecosystem

## Overview

The Wave ecosystem is more than just a programming language.
Wave is a comprehensive development ecosystem that combines various tools, libraries, and a cohesive development philosophy to empower programmers to work creatively in any field.

## Components of the Wave Ecosystem

### Wave

At the core of the Wave ecosystem lies the Wave programming language.
It is designed based on the philosophies of C and Rust, aiming to strike a balance between low-level control and high-level productivity.

- **Easy learning curve**: Moderate difficulty level, between C and Rust.
- **Powerful features**: Supports a wide range of data types such as pointers, arrays, and serialization.

### Standard Library

Wave provides a rich standard library so developers can avoid unnecessary dependency on external libraries.

- **hardware**: Hardware control
- **http**: HTTP and WebSocket communication
- **iosys**: File and stream I/O
- **sys**: System control
- **wson**: High-performance data serialization format
- **quantum**: Quantum computing support

### Community and Ecosystem Philosophy

Wave values not only the language itself but also interaction with developers.

- **Developer-centered design**: Respects diverse languages and cultures.
- **Support for minority and endangered languages**: Embraces global linguistic diversity.
- **Future-oriented technology**: Supports quantum computing and next-generation security standards.

### Toolchain

Wave maximizes productivity through highly refined development tools.

- **Wave Package Manager (Vex)**: Platform-independent build and deployment.
- **Wave Debugger**: Intuitive debugging.
