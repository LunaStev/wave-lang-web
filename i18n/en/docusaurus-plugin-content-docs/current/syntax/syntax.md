# Syntax

This document explains the overall syntax of the Wave programming language.
As Wave is a language currently under development, some syntax and features have not yet been fully implemented or may change in the future.
Nevertheless, this document is written with the intention of understanding the syntax structure and core concepts that Wave aims for at this point.

Through this document, readers can understand both the current state of Wave and gain an overall picture of the direction in which the language is being designed and expanded.

Wave is designed as a language that combines low-level control with high-level abstraction.
It is designed with the aim of being widely applicable from low-level areas like system programming, to high-level application fields like web development, artificial intelligence, and blockchain.
To achieve this, Wave adopts syntax and structure that emphasizes performance and control without compromising productivity.

Additionally, Wave is designed with a powerful standard library and integrated build and tool system in mind, aiming to allow developers to focus on implementing core logic without spending time on complex configurations.

The syntax of Wave has elements similar to C or Rust, but it is not intended to be a mere imitation.
Based on familiar syntax elements, it is restructured to quickly learn the language and use it efficiently in actual development.
An explicit type system, predictable behavior, and syntax that reveals the intent of the code are key design criteria.

This document introduces the basic syntax and main language features of Wave along with practical examples.
Each section explains individual syntax elements, and overall it's arranged to understand the structure and design philosophy of the Wave language.
