# Syntax

This document explains the syntax of the Wave programming language. The design of Wave is still under development, so some of the syntax and features may not be finalized or may change.
However, this document helps understand the current state and key concepts, providing insights into future development directions.

Wave is designed as a language combining low-level control and high-level abstraction, suitable for various fields such as **system programming, web development, artificial intelligence, and blockchain**.
This language not only offers excellent performance and flexibility but also supports developers to work efficiently through a powerful standard library and an integrated build system.

The syntax of Wave is similar to languages like C and Rust but is designed to allow developers to quickly learn the language and increase productivity.
This document introduces the basic syntax and features of Wave with practical examples.
