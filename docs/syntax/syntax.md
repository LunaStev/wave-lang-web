# Introduction to Wave Syntax

This document will explain the syntax of the Wave programming language. Since Wave's design is still evolving, some aspects of the syntax and features may be incomplete or subject to change. However, this document aims to provide an understanding of the language's current state and key concepts, offering insight into its future development direction.

Wave is a language designed to combine **low-level control with high-level abstractions, making it suitable for various fields such as system programming**, web development, AI, and blockchain. The language provides not only performance and flexibility but also a powerful standard library and an integrated build system to help developers work efficiently.

The syntax of Wave shares similarities with languages like C and Rust, but it is designed to enable developers to quickly engage with the language and boost productivity. This document will introduce the fundamental syntax and features of Wave, along with practical examples.
