# WLSA-2025-0001 â€” Test Advisory

This is a test advisory created to validate the `/security` site implementation for the Wave project.

## Details

A test vulnerability in the WSON parser simulates an out-of-bounds memory read when processing specially crafted malformed data structures.
This issue does **not** exist in any real version of Wave.

```wave
var data: ptr<u8> = ...;
// Hypothetical out-of-bounds read
```

## Resolution

Upgrade to Wave `0.1.4-pre-beta` to ensure this issue is not present.

## Credits

This advisory was created by the Wave team solely for testing and validation purposes.
