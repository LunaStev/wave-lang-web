Hello! I'm LunaStev, the developer of Wave.

We are very happy to introduce Wave `v0.0.7-pre-beta`.

This release has previously addressed the issue of infinite recursive and stack overflow due to incorrect ASTNode reuse.

We also changed the name of the Wave compiler binary from `wave` to `wavec`.

Wave is growing fast, and we are very excited to share our future plans.

## üîß Bug Fixes

### üêõ Fixed else if IR Infinite Loop Bug
* Resolved a critical bug where `stmt` was reused inside the `else if` block IR generation loop
* Previously caused infinite recursion and stack overflow due to incorrect ASTNode reuse
* Fixed by replacing `stmt` with `else_if` when iterating over `else_if_blocks`

## ‚ú® Other Changes

### üõ† Renamed `wave` to `wavec`
* Renamed the Wave compiler binary from `wave` to `wavec`
* This change was made to prepare for the integration of Vex, the official package manager for Wave
* Separating the compiler tool (`wavec`) from the language name (`Wave`) aligns with future plans for Vex integration
