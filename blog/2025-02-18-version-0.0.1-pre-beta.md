Hello! Iâ€™m LunaStev, the developer of **Wave**, and Iâ€™m excited to announce the release of **v0.0.1-pre-beta**. While itâ€™s still an early version, Iâ€™m happy to share this first usable version of Wave with you all. Thereâ€™s a lot to improve, but this release shows the direction Iâ€™m heading with the project.

In this version, you can now use LLVM to create binary files from Wave code. Although there are still many limitations, this release gives you a glimpse into how Wave is progressing. Letâ€™s take a closer look at whatâ€™s new and how you can get started.

## New Features in v0.0.1-pre-beta

1. LLVM Support for Binary Creation

With v0.0.1-pre-beta, you can use LLVM to compile Wave code into binary files. This means you can now actually run Wave code and see it in action. However, there are a few limitations:

* You can only print output using Println or the print command. Multiple prints may not work as expected in this version.

2. Temporary Suspension of Windows Support

Due to some issues with LLVM on Windows, support for Windows has been temporarily suspended. This version is Linux-only for now, but I plan to bring back Windows support in future updates once the issues are resolved. Thanks for your understanding!

## Showcase
Here are some preview images of the new functionality in action:

## Installation Guide
If youâ€™re ready to try Wave, hereâ€™s how to get started:

### For Linux:

1. Download and Extract

Download the wave-v0.0.1-pre-beta-linux.tar.gz file from the [official release page](https://github.com/LunaStev/Wave/releases/tag/v0.0.1-pre-beta).
You can also download it directly using this command:

```bash
wget https://github.com/LunaStev/Wave/releases/download/v0.0.1-pre-beta/wave-v0.0.1-pre-beta-linux.tar.gz
```

Then, extract the archive with:

```bash
sudo tar -xvzf wave-v0.0.1-pre-beta-linux.tar.gz -C /opt
```

2. Set Environment Variables

Add the Wave binary to your PATH by editing your shell configuration file (`~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`):

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/opt
```

Apply the changes by running:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

3. Set up LLVM

Wave relies on LLVM for binary creation, so youâ€™ll need to install it. Run the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install llvm-14 llvm-14-dev clang-14 libclang-14-dev lld-14 clang
sudo ln -s /usr/lib/llvm-14/lib/libLLVM-14.so /usr/lib/libllvm-14.so
export LLVM_SYS_140_PREFIX=/usr/lib/llvm-14
source ~/.bashrc
```

4. Verify Installation

To check if the installation was successful, type the following:

```bash
wave --version
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see the version number!

## Wrapping Up
Wave is still in its early stages, but Iâ€™m committed to making it a powerful and flexible language. I appreciate all your support and feedback as I continue to improve it. I hope youâ€™ll enjoy exploring this version, and I look forward to hearing what you think!

Stay tuned for the next release!
