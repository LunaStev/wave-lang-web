Hello! I'm LunaStev, the developer of Wave.

We are excited to announce Wave `v0.1.1-pre-beta` ‚Äî
This update introduces inline assembly (`asm {}`) support, enabling you to write low-level system code directly in Wave, such as making syscalls with direct register manipulation.

Additionally, Wave now fully supports pointer chaining (`ptr<ptr<i32>>`) and array types (`array<T, N>`), including index access, address-of operations, and validation of literal lengths ‚Äî expanding Wave's capability for systems-level and memory-safe programming.

These improvements bring Wave closer to its vision as a low-level but expressive programming language.

## ‚úÖ Added Features
### ‚öôÔ∏è Inline Assembly (`asm { ... }`) Support
* Introduced `asm { ... }` block syntax to embed raw assembly instructions directly within Wave code.

* Supports instruction strings (e.g., `"syscall"`) and explicit register constraints via `in("reg") var` and `out("reg") var`.

* Variables used in `in(...)` are passed into specified registers; variables in `out(...)` receive output from registers.

* Supports passing literal constants directly to registers (e.g., `in("rax") 60`).

* Pointer values (e.g., `ptr<i8>`) are correctly passed to registers such as `rsi`, enabling low-level syscalls like `write`.

* Internally leverages LLVM's inline assembly mechanism using Intel syntax.

* Currently supports single-output only; multiple `out(...)` constraints will overwrite each other.

* Does not yet support clobber lists or advanced constraint combinations.

* Provides essential capability for system-level programming (e.g., making direct syscalls, writing device-level code).

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This is not a fully general-purpose inline ASM facility yet, but it enables practical low-level operations within Wave. Full support is planned for later phases.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Make pointer chain explicit
* Nested parsing like `ptr<i32>`, `ptr<ptr<i32>>`

* Can create `ptr<T>` for any type (no restrictions on `T`)

* Support for consecutive `deref` operations (e.g., `deref deref deref`)

### ‚öôÔ∏è Array type complete

* IndexAccess (`numbers[0]`) handling

* ArrayLiteral ‚Üí Parse into AST and validate length

* AddressOf ‚Üí Support array literals with address-of values (e.g., `[&a, &b]`)

* Confirmed that `array<T, N>` supports any type as T

## ‚ú® Other Changes
### üß† Library and Binary 2 Coexist

* Add lib.rs for easy package manager creation, development, and easy access.

## Installation Guide

### For Linux:

1. **Download and Extract:**
    - Download the `wave-v0.1.1-pre-beta-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz` file from the official source.
    - Use the wget command:
      ```bash
      wget https://github.com/LunaStev/Wave/releases/download/v0.1.1-pre-beta/wave-v0.1.1-pre-beta-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz
      ```
    - Extract the archive:
      ```bash
      sudo tar -xvzf wave-v0.1.1-pre-beta-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz -C /usr/local/bin
      ```

3. Setting up LLVMs
    - Open a terminal and type:
      ```bash
      sudo apt-get update
      sudo apt-get install llvm-14 llvm-14-dev clang-14 libclang-14-dev lld-14 clang
      sudo ln -s /usr/lib/llvm-14/lib/libLLVM-14.so /usr/lib/libllvm-14.so
      export LLVM_SYS_140_PREFIX=/usr/lib/llvm-14
      source ~/.bashrc
      ```

4. **Verify Installation:**
    - Open a terminal and type:
      ```bash
      wavec --version
      ```
    - If the version number displays, the installation was successful.
