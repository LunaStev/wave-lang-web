Hello! I'm Lunastev, the developer of Wave.

We are very excited to introduce Wave 'v0.0.9-Free Beta' —
A version that offers Explicit Mutability, Smarter Functions, and Safer Pointers.

Wave is designed with low-level features in mind, and in this version,
We are making a big leap in that direction.

## 📐 Language Specification Updates
### 🧠 Introduction of `let`, `let mut`, and var for Explicit Mutability
* Wave now supports three types of variable declarations to express mutability explicitly:

    * `var`: fully mutable, intended for general-purpose variables

    * `let`: immutable, reassignment is forbidden

    * `let mut`: mutable under immutable declaration context (safe controlled mutability)

* This design introduces clearer ownership intent and improves safety in low-level and system-oriented programming.

### 🧠 Default Parameter Values in Function Declarations
* Wave functions can now define parameters with default values:
    ```wave
    fun main(name: str = "World") {
        println("Hello {}", name);
    }
    ```

* If an argument is not provided at runtime, the default value will be inserted automatically by the compiler.

* This enables more expressive and flexible function declarations.

## ✅ Added Features
### 🧠 Parser and IR support for explicit mutability
* Introduced internal Mutability enum: `Var`, `Let`, `LetMut`

* Implemented `parse_let()` with optional mut keyword for parsing

* Wave's IR generation now restricts `let` variables from being reassigned

### 🧠 IR handling of function parameter defaults
* When default values are present in function parameters, they are now correctly recognized and handled during LLVM IR generation

* If an argument is not passed at runtime, the default value is inserted directly into the stack-allocated variable

## 🔧 Bug Fixes

### 🐛 Incorrect string output in `println()` format
* Fixed an issue where `str` values (`i8*`) were printed as raw addresses

* The format translation now maps `i8*` to `%s` correctly

* Values are passed directly to `printf` as string pointers, avoiding `ptr_to_int` conversion

### 🐛 Incorrect handling of `deref` assignment
* Fixed an issue where dereferencing a pointer and assigning its value caused type mismatches in the generated IR.

* The IR now properly handles dereferencing a pointer (`deref p1 = deref p2;`) and assigning the values correctly without causing `i32**` mismatches.

## ✨ Other Changes

### 🧠 IR-level enforcement of immutability
* Reassignment attempts to `let` variables now cause a compile-time panic

* All memory operations (store/load) respect mutability constraints

### 🧠 IR-level enforcement of pointer dereferencing
* Introduced a fix to ensure that pointer dereferencing (`deref p1 = deref p2;`) is handled correctly in the IR.

* Adjusted the `generate_address_ir()` function to properly dereference pointers and load/store values without causing pointer type mismatches.

## Installation Guide

### For Linux:

1. **Download and Extract:**
    - Download the `wave-v0.0.9-pre-beta-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz` file from the official source.
    - Use the wget command:
      ```bash
      wget https://github.com/LunaStev/Wave/releases/download/v0.0.9-pre-beta/wave-v0.0.9-pre-beta-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz
      ```
    - Extract the archive:
      ```bash
      sudo tar -xvzf wave-v0.0.9-pre-beta-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz -C /usr/local/bin
      ```

3. Setting up LLVMs
    - Open a terminal and type:
      ```bash
      sudo apt-get update
      sudo apt-get install llvm-14 llvm-14-dev clang-14 libclang-14-dev lld-14 clang
      sudo ln -s /usr/lib/llvm-14/lib/libLLVM-14.so /usr/lib/libllvm-14.so
      export LLVM_SYS_140_PREFIX=/usr/lib/llvm-14
      source ~/.bashrc
      ```

4. **Verify Installation:**
    - Open a terminal and type:
      ```bash
      wavec --version
      ```
    - If the version number displays, the installation was successful.
