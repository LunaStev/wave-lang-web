title: "Introduction to Wave v0.1.2-pre-beta: Assignment Operators, Added Remainder and Generalized Indexing Support"

Hello! I'm LunaStev, the developer of Wave.

We are pleased to announce Wave `v0.1.2-pre-beta` ‚Äî
This update supports indexing, supports the rest of the operators. And I added an assignment operator. And I fixed a number of bugs.

---

## ‚úÖ Added Features
### üîç Generalized Indexing Support
* Extended `arr[index]` syntax to support **variable indexing** in any context.

* Now supports dynamic indexing like `arr[i]`, `ptr[j]`, `get_array()[k]` inside `if`, `while`, `return`, and assignments.

* Internally handles pointer types (e.g., `i8*`) using `GEP` and performs automatic type casting (e.g., `i8` vs `i64`) for comparisons and assignments.

### ‚ûï Added `%` (Remainder) Operator Support
* Wave now supports the modulo operator `%` for integer types.

* Expressions like `a % b`, `10 % 3`, and `var x: i32 = a % b` are now fully parsed and compiled to LLVM IR using srem (signed remainder).

* Parser was updated to recognize `%` as `TokenType::Remainder`, and IR generation uses `build_int_signed_rem` for correct runtime behavior.

* `%` is fully supported inside expressions, assignments, conditionals, and return statements.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Assignment Operators (`+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`)
* Supports compound assignment operators for both integers (`i32`) and floating-point numbers (`f32`).

* Operators implemented: `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`.

* Type-safe operation with proper distinction between integer and float IR instructions:
   * add, sub, mul, sdiv, srem for integers.

   * `fadd`, `fsub`, `fmul`, `fdiv`, `frem` (uses `fmodf`) for floats.

* Implicit type casting during assignment (e.g., assigning an int to a float variable triggers `int` ‚Üí `float` conversion).

* Proper LLVM IR generation for all supported operations, including float remainder via external `fmodf` call (linked with `-lm`).

## üêõ Bug Fixes

### üî¢ Accurate Token Differentiation Between Integers and Floats
* Number parsing logic has been overhauled to properly distinguish between integer literals (e.g., `42`) and floating-point literals (e.g., `3.14`, `42.0`).

* Previously, all numeric literals were parsed as `Float(f64)` tokens, even when no decimal point was present.
  ‚Üí Now, tokens like `123` are correctly parsed as `Number(i64)`, and `123.45` as `Float(f64)`.

* Introduced internal flag `is_float` to detect presence of `.` during scanning. If found, the number is parsed as a float; otherwise, as an integer.

* Implemented type-safe error handling:

   * Fallbacks to `TokenType::Number(0)` or `TokenType::Float(0.0)` on parse failure, ensuring the lexer remains stable on malformed input.

* This fix improves downstream type checking, IR generation, and expression evaluation, especially for typed languages like Wave where `i64` and `f64` must be handled distinctly.

## ‚ú® Other Changes
### üß† Library and Binary 2 Coexist

* Add lib.rs for easy package manager creation, development, and easy access.
