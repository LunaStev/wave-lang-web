Hello! I'm LunaStev, the developer of Wave.

We are very happy to introduce Wave `v0.0.8-pre-beta` —
a version that officially brings first-class pointer support to the language.

Wave was designed with low-level capabilities in mind, and in this version,
we’re making a major leap in that direction.

## ✅ Added Features
### 🧠 Pointer System: First-Class Pointer Support in Wave

* Introduced `ptr<T>` type syntax for defining typed pointers  
  → Example: `var p: ptr<i32>;`

* Implemented `&x` address-of operator  
  → Compiles to LLVM IR as `store i32* %x`

* Implemented `deref p` dereference operator  
  → Generates IR as `load i32, i32* %p`

* Supported pointer-based initialization  
  → `var p: ptr<i32> = &x;` is now fully parsed and compiled

* Enabled dereferencing for both expression and assignment  
  → Example: `deref p = 42;` is valid and stored directly via IR

* Address values can be printed as integers  
  → `%ld` used for pointer-to-int cast in formatted output  
  → `println("address = {}", p);` prints memory address

## 🔧 Bug Fixes

### 🐛 Fixed Pointer Initialization Parsing Issue
* Changed `VariableNode.initial_value` from `Option<Literal>` to `Option<Expression>`
* Allowed `&x` to be accepted as a valid initializer expression

### 🐛 Fixed LLVM IR Crash on AddressOf Expression
* Added support for `Expression::AddressOf` in IR generation
* Prevented crash by checking for variable reference inside address-of

### 🐛 Fixed printf format mismatch for pointers
* `%s` → `%ld` for pointer values
* Ensured correct casting of `i32*` to `i64` before printing

## ✨ Other Changes

### 🧠 Improved Format String Handling in IR
* Added dynamic format string generation based on argument types
* Format strings now automatically adapt for int, float, and pointer types

    - Use the wget command:
      ```bash
      wget https://github.com/LunaStev/Wave/releases/download/v0.0.8-pre-beta/wave-v0.0.8-pre-beta-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz
      ```
    - Extract the archive:
      ```bash
      sudo tar -xvzf wave-v0.0.8-pre-beta-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz -C /usr/local/bin
      ```

3. Setting up LLVMs
    - Open a terminal and type:
      ```bash
      sudo apt-get update
      sudo apt-get install llvm-14 llvm-14-dev clang-14 libclang-14-dev lld-14 clang
      sudo ln -s /usr/lib/llvm-14/lib/libLLVM-14.so /usr/lib/libllvm-14.so
      export LLVM_SYS_140_PREFIX=/usr/lib/llvm-14
      source ~/.bashrc
      ```

4. **Verify Installation:**
    - Open a terminal and type:
      ```bash
      wavec --version
      ```
    - If the version number displays, the installation was successful.
