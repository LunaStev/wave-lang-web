Hello! I'm LunaStev, the developer of Wave. I'm very excited to release the v0.0.5 pre-beta version. I'm very excited to share the 5th version of Wave.

In this version, we have added a `while` statement.

---

## ✅ Added Features
### 🔁 Loops: Full Support for while Statements

* Basic `while` loops

* Nested `while` loops

* Variable declaration and initialization inside loops

* Loop termination condition handling (supports comparison operators like `<=`, `<`, `==`, etc.)

* print and println functions work inside loops

### 🧨 Control Flow

* Support for `break` statements

* Allows breaking out of loops in the middle

* Works correctly even inside nested loops

* (⏳ Next version: `continue` support planned)

### 🧠 Variable Handling

* Fully correct local variable scoping (e.g., a new `j` is created in each loop)

* Supports `var` declarations (must specify types like `i32`, `u32`, etc.)

* Allows variable reassignment (handles patterns like `i = i + 1`)
